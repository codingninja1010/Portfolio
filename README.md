## Overview

This is the source code for my portfolio website. It showcases my skills, experience, projects, achievements, education, and ways to get in touch. The site is a single-page app with smooth section navigation, subtle animations, and a strong focus on performance and accessibility.

## Features

- Responsive, mobile-first layout with polished UI
- Smooth in-page navigation with scroll offset handling
- Page transition animations and scroll progress bar
- Accessible components (tooltips, toasts, buttons, inputs)
- Error boundary for graceful runtime error handling
- Optimized, cached static assets (Vite build)
- Dark-friendly palette and glassmorphism accents

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + Vite 5
- Tailwind CSS 3 (+ tailwindcss-animate)
- Framer Motion 10/12 for animations
- Radix UI primitives via custom components
- React Router v6 (client-side routing)
- @tanstack/react-query for data fetching primitives
- ESLint 9 for code quality
